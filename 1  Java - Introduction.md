Java, first created at the hight of the .com boom, is one of the most powerful and popular languages in the world. It is used all over the world, on all types of systems from Microsoft, Unix, Mac OSX, Solaris and even servers. It has the ability to be compiled once and run on numerous platforms which means it is easily accessible and very powerful.

## History
Java was first developed in 1996 by Sun Microsystems and quickly gained a big following. It has since been through 8 iterations, with the 9th due to be released soon. Each version has built on it's predecesor adding new features, more power and quicker run time.

### Java Timeline

  * Java 1.0: Released 1996, Initial release.
  * Java 1.1: Released 1997, Web browsers support Applets.
  * Java 1.2: Released 1998, Biggest release so far, called Java 2.0. New API called Swing for creating GUI.
  * Java 1.3: Released 2000 Java 2 version 1.3, performance update.
  * Java 1.4: Released 2001, More improvements, called Java 2 version 1.4.
  * Java 1.5: Released 2004, Now called either Java 2 version 1.5.0 or Java 5, Biggest update ever.
  * Java 1.6: Released 2006, Now just called Java 6.
  * Java 1.7: Released 2011, minor improvement to API and language.
  * Java 1.8: Released 2014, Java 8, adds some big features such as *lambda* expresions, reworked API for Time & Date and ability to use multicore processessors.
  * Java 1.9: Released 2017, Java 9, Adds long awaited *Java Module System*.

## Why is Java so important?

Java has many features that make it a useful and powerful tool to use when coding. These include:

  * **Platform Inderpendence:** Java can run on any platform that has the *Java Runtime Environment* **JRE** installed. That includes PC's, Macs, Phones and servers. The reason this is, is because Java doesn't run on the system hardware, but on a *Java Virtual Machine* **JVM**. That means that a developer only has to write the code once for his app to work on any hardware running the **JVM**. When a Java file is compiled, it is turned into a `.class` file. The **JVM** uses this `.class` file to run the Java code. Because Java is compiled to the machine language of the **JVM**, not the machine code of the hardware, the same file can be sent to Windows and Mac alike as long as they're running the **JRE**.
  * **Object Orientation:** An Object is a programming entity that represents either a real-world object, or an abstract concept.
  * **The Java API:** The API is a vast library of code available to a Java programmer of classes and objects already written, allowing Java to run some very important and complicated code. 
  * **The Internet:** Because Java was developed at the hight of the proliforation of the intenet, it takes full advantage of the internet. The **JVM** being able to run on any hardware means that Java can go anywhere it's needed on the internet. Java has three main uses on the Internet:
      * *Servlets:* Java programs that run on Internet servers, not the Users computer.
      * *Applets:* Java programs that run on Web Browsers.
      * *Web Start Applications*: Java Programs designed to be launched from a web page and run on the users computer.
  * **Type Checking:** The way a language stores different types of data. In Java, you must make sure you declare what type of data the variable will hold so that it can be checked. Other languages aren't so bothered about this, and that can cause errors.
  * **Automatic Memory Management:** Java doesn't require you to free up memory used to store data. It will automatically do it if it detects the data is no longer used. Other languages specifically require you to tell the programme what to do with that memory when finished. This can cause memory leaks, which use up more Computer memory and eventually use it all up.
  * **Exception Handling:** If an error occurs born from the code, Java can handle the error better because it can block out errors and allow you to fix them before they crash the program. This makes Java programs more stable.

## Java Donwsides:

Although I've been reporting that Java is the best thing since sliced bread, it does have some shortcommings:
  * API is massive.
  * API overdesigned.
  * Some areas of the API are badly coded.
  * Doesn't truly support decimal data.

## Java Abreviations:
* **JRE:** Java Runtime Environment.
* **JDK:** Java Developer Kit.
* **JVM:** Java Virtual Machine.
* **SDK:** Software Development Kit (the name for the **JRE** between Java 1.2 - Java 1.4.
* **Java SE:** Java Second Edition, the consumer version of Java.
* **J2SE:** Java 2 Standard Edition.
* **Java EE:** Java Enterprise Edition (used on servers and in businesses).
